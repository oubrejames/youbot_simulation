# nextTask Simulation
For this simulation I used a PID controller with gains of P = 4, I = 0.01, and D = P.

The new initial configuration of the block is at (0.5, -0.5) and the new final configuration is at
(2,1)

From the error plot shown in this folder, it can be seen that the error converges to zero very quickly
but there is a small spike around 1000 ms in the X and Z error. While these errors are larger than 
the best scenario, they are still sufficiently small.
