# Overshoot Simulation
For this simulation I used a PID controller with gains of P = 20, I = 6, and D = P.


From the error plot shown in this folder, it can be seen that the error oscillates rapidly early on.
This causes very jerky behavior in the robots motion. However, the error still converges to zero
quickly.
