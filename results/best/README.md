# Best Simulation
For this simulation I used a PID controller with gains of P = 4, I = 0.01, and D = P.

From the error plot shown in this folder, it can be seen that the error converges to zero very quickly
but there is a small spike around 1000 ms in the X and Z error. This error is negligible, however.
